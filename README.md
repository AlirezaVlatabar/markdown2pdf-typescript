## Overview

Welcome to the markdown2pdf-typescript repository! This project provides a TypeScript client for the markdown2pdf.ai service, enabling seamless conversion from Markdown to PDF. This tool is designed for agents who communicate in Markdown but deliver final outputs in PDF, bridging the gap in your workflow.

### Why Markdown to PDF?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows for easy formatting of text. However, when it comes to sharing documents with clients or stakeholders, PDF remains the preferred format. Our TypeScript client allows agents to convert Markdown documents into polished PDFs effortlessly. 

## Features

- **Simple Conversion**: Convert Markdown files to PDF with minimal setup.
- **No Sign-Ups**: Start using the service without the hassle of sign-up forms.
- **Cost-Effective**: Pay only for what you use, measured in bytes.
- **Lightning Network Support**: Integrate with Bitcoin wallets for fast transactions.
- **Open Source**: Contribute to the project and help improve it.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlirezaVlatabar/markdown2pdf-typescript.git
cd markdown2pdf-typescript
```

Next, install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Once you have the package installed, you can use it in your TypeScript projects. Here's a simple example of how to convert a Markdown file to PDF:

```typescript
import { convertMarkdownToPDF } from 'markdown2pdf-typescript';

const markdownFilePath = 'path/to/your/file.md';
const outputFilePath = 'path/to/output/file.pdf';

convertMarkdownToPDF(markdownFilePath, outputFilePath)
  .then(() => {
    console.log('PDF generated successfully!');
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error generating PDF:', error);
  });
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to import the conversion function and use it to generate a PDF from a Markdown file.
